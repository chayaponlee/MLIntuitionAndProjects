This repository is for sharing what I learned about regression and classification. 

Each jupyter notebook will contain many modoels such as random forests and SVM. 
There will be captions explaining useful theories and analysis as the code goes along.

THe data that is used for classification models is based on social ad response. It is 
based on the scenario that if a vehicle company send out ad offers to certain people
on facebook, will those people choose to buy the car or not. 

The regression models are seperated in different notebooks to avoid messiness. It is based
on two datasets Position Salaries and 50 Start Ups. In 50 Start Ups, we are trying to find
a way to spot good companies invest in. This means figure out what features are important.
Position Salaries contain data on different salaries of different positions (in years of experience)
on a company. We will try to develop the best model that can future detect lies from 
prospective employees about their previous company's salary. 

The gist here is that you will be able to learn by comparing different models because
evaluating perfomance is forever important.
